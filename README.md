Simple Window Saver makes it super easy to save and restore windows. Keep one window for work tabs, one for Gmail and Facebook, and one for your vacation planning or the research on that new TV you want to buy.

As the title reveals, simplicity is the name of the game. Unlike other session managers, Simple Window Saver remembers when you've saved a window and keeps track of changes. It's not full of features you don't need â€“ it does what you want and it does it well.

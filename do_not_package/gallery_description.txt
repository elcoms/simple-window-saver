Good ol' Simple Window Saver is back!
Simple Window Saver makes it super easy to save and restore windows. Keep one window for work tabs, one for Gmail and Facebook, and one for your vacation planning or the research on that new TV you want to buy.

As the title reveals, simplicity is the name of the game. Unlike other session managers, Simple Window Saver remembers when you've saved a window and keeps track of changes. It's not full of features you don't need â€“ it does what you want and it does it well.

Go ahead, give it a try!

Note: it does not work well with Tab Groups. Please do not use it with Tab Groups.

If you have feedback or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact me at elcoms.khang@gmail.com. And if you like this extension, remember to give it a good rating!

- - Data collection - -
Simple Window Saver uses Google Analytics only to track installs.

I DO NOT track the urls or titles of the windows/tabs you save, or the names of the saved windows. If you have any concerns about this, you are welcome to inspect the source code (github link below, or use Chrome's web inspector).

This is restoration of the original Simple Windows Saver by Nick Baum.
